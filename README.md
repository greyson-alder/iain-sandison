- Hi, I’m @iain-sandison, an MChem graduate and software engineering consultant currently working with Bright Network
- I’ve recently been having a play about with Java and PHP mostly, creating small projects with an increasing number of coding topics
- I'm still very new, having started my coding career as part of the BNTA from February 2021 but I some day hope to leave my mark on the industry
- If you would like to reach me for any reason then fire me an email at: iain.sandison.mousa@gmail.com
