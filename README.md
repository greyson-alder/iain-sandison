- Hi, I’m @iain-sandison, an MChem graduate and Technical Operations Executive currently working with Bright Network
- I’ve recently been having a play about with generative art, creating small projects with an increasing number of coding topics
- I'm still very new, having started my coding career as part of the BNTA in February 2021 but if you would like to reach me for any reason then fire me an email at: iain.sandison.mousa@gmail.com
